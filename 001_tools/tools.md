# The tools that I use for programming

## My chosen operating system is Linux.

I am currently using Manjaro Linux. I have grown quite fond of both its ease of use as well as being able to use the latest tools.

For my desktop, I am using Gnome. Gnome is one of the many desktop environments that use the GTK toolkit.

## My chosen language is c++. (g++, gdb, and nemiver)

I will be using the gcc compiler suite -- specifically g++. And since all programmers should have a debugger waiting to be used, I use the gdb debugger with the nemiver graphical front end.

## My current chosen text editor is code-oss

I still have multiple text editors on my system that I use periodically, but code-oss works really well with Clang and Clangd for code completion and quick reference.

## I use a tool called bear to create compile_commands.json

For the code completion and quick reference to work correctly, it needs compile commands and locations. These are easily supplied by a command line utility called bear.

## I use make

I use make to execute the commands in makefile. For simple programs, I create the makefile by hand.
